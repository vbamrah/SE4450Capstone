# SE4450 Capstone Fitmoji
In recent years, health and wellness applications and trackers have become increasingly popular. The fitness app industry boasts a rapidly expanding market due to increased consumer demands and healthy living trends. For our capstone project, our group has chosen to target this growing market and develop an innovative solution to make healthy living simple and attractive. 
The FitMoji mobile app provides users with an interactive visual representation of their lifestyle goals and progress. Where this application differs from its existing competitors is the way in which it motivates its users: an interactive, personalized interface in the form of an avatar. Users are able to customize and engage with their avatar to reflect their desired fitness, nutrition, water intake, and sleep goals. The avatar notifies users with information about their progress and provides them with suggestions on how to best meet and stay on track with their goals, making leading a healthy lifestyle easy and engaging. FitMoji creates a positive and innovative environment for its users to track all aspects of their health and wellness in one place, focusing on motivation, positive reinforcement, and personal well-being
